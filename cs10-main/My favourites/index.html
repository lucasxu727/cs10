    <h2>Badminton</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="bMargin">
      Badminton is a sport and hobby I have enjoyed for many years. I have been
      playing badminton for around 3-4 years and used to play competitively.
      Ever since covid, I have dropped badminton as a competitive sport and
      havebeen playing recreationally.

    <p class="bMargin">
      I travelled to Alaska on a cruise during my elementary years. I saw many
      beautiful sights and sceneries, as well as eating many different types of
      food I haven't tried before.

    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I have been playing chess on and off for a few years. Before, I use to
      actively indulge in the sport when I was in chess club, however, I play
      less frequently now. Some of my favourite openers are:

    <ul class="bMargin">
      <li>London System</li>
      <li>Vienna Gambit</li>
      <li>Sicilian Defence</li>
    </ul>
